There are a few things I want you to have handy as you start your journey into web development. They will make your learning experience much better.

### A good text editor (IDE)
It's very important you have a good text editor to work with or an IDE. An IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a fancy term for a good text editor with lots of tools to help you write and manage code. Writing and working in code is a lot different than writing a book or document. So make sure you take the time to get setup with a good one:

You will need a good IDE that uses mono spaced type face with no formatting.

**My favorites:**

- [Notepad++ for PC](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)
- [Komodo edit for Mac or PC](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)
- [Coda for Mac](http://www.panic.com/coda)
- [TextMate for Mac](http://macromates.com)
- [TextWrangler for Mac](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler)

### A good browser
If your going to do web development, then you should understand that not all browsers are alike. All web browsers render pages and javascript slightly differently. This makes it hard for the web developer to create a consistent experience for all users.

As you develop your applications, you are going to need to test them in your browser. Some browsers really lend themselves to web development by offering add-on tools and features.

I would recommend that you download and install one of the following browsers:

- Mozzila Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Apple Safari

### Web developer toolbar
If your using Firefox, I highly recommend this the add-on/extension. It will allow you to do various things like disable javascript, disable/enable styles, as well as a number of other great features

### Firebug

### MySQL GUI client

### Blogs and reference
This book will only take you so far, so I would recommend the following resources to help you:

|Site|What it covers|
|-|-|
|[PHP Functional reference](http://php.net)|This is where you will find all the PHP reference documentation. This is probably the most popular page for getting information and syntax help on the language. There is also tons of code examples, the user contributed notes.|

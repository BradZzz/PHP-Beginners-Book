Once you get more established with the PHP language, I would strongly recommend that you start looking to move to a PHP Frameworks.

Frameworks are an existing set of application code that you start projects with. They come out of the box with most of code you need to do common things in web applications. Such as Login & Authentication, Authorization, Database access, Security, etc.

They take out the repetition and let you write more code specific to your own application (business logic). You spend less time messing around on code that is not specific to your application, like database calls and such.

**Some of the more popular PHP Frameworks are:**

- [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org)
- [ZF Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com)
- [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com)
- [Symfony](www.symfony-project.org)

I have been programming web applications for years, and I wouldn't think twice about not using a framework. They just save you a lot of time. However, it does come at a cost. You need to take a while to learn the conventions of the framework. This is why I don't recommend starting here. A framework is only as good as how well it is documented, and how much you invest to learn it. Once you master the language and the framework, you will find you can create applications very quickly. In a recent coding contest at Boston PHP, I witnessed a fully working web application being built in under 30 minutes.

All these frameworks follow a could of important principles:

- **CRUD:** Stands for Create Read Update, and Delete
- **RAD:** Rapid Application Development
- **DRY:** Don't repeat yourself
- **KISS:** Keep It Simple Stupid

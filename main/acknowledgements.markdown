I would like to thank everyone who helped write this book.

### Tools I used to write this book

- **[iaWriter for the Mac](http://www.iawriter.com):** This is a great distraction free writing tool for the Mac. It allows the author to write effortlessly in Markdown format. The output format is a text file that uses Markdown to signify headings, emphasis, etc. 
- **[CakePHP Framework](http://www.cakephp.org):** I wrote a little CakePHP app that takes the Markdown text file and formats it for the web. It converts the Markdown to suitable HTML elements, as well as automatically creating a table of contents and index.
- **[Komodo IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide):** My favorite IDE for writing code. All the examples in this book were typed into Komodo and tested there are well. I also used Komodo to create and edit the CakePHP application.
- **[GitHub](http://www.github.com):** I am using Git and GitHub to store and vault both the book and the CakePHP source code. Read the section on Source Code Control to learn more about it.
- **[Git Tower](http://www.git-tower.com):** This is a GUI client for Git and GitHub. At heart, I am still a GUI lover and I struggle to do everything from the terminal. GitTower is a great product that makes it easy to commit code, and diff your changes.
- **[BeanTownHost](http://www.beantownhost.com):** Boston PHP uses BeanTown Host as our web hosting service. They are great to work with, inexpensive, and cater to your needs. Check them out at [http://beantownhost.com]()
- **[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown):**
- **[Print and Media stylesheets](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2009/05/05/how-to-create-a-simple-print-css-for-your-site):** You might notice that if you print or are reading this book in PDF format, that links are actually written in the text. However if you are reading this online, then the links are actually real hyperlink that you can click. This is because I am using two different CSS stylesheets one for print and the other for the screen. This lets me enhance the online experience, yet provide a book format that works as well.

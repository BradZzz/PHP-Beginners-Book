There are lots of books out there that teach you the PHP language by syntax, with examples and code that you have to type or paste. Frankly, I am tired of this approach and it is boring for the learner. I have met many would-be PHP developers that have read books, gone through training, tutorials, and other types of approaches and they still don't learn.
 
This book takes a different approach. I will teach you by giving you small development challenges. You will work on these development challenges and learn by seeing and doing. It is a unique and fun way to learn that will get you coding faster, since you are applying what you learn step by step.

You should already have some basic understanding and experience in creating HTML pages and a little CSS.

### More than just PHP
This book aims to go beyond PHP. We will cover all the things a PHP developer should know like HTML, CSS, Databases, and jQuery. Look to the later chapters to learn more.

### Work in progress
This book is a work in progress. We are constantly adding to it and editing it to make it better. It's not completed yet. So you might save it locally, print it, or save to PDF so you don't see change while your using it.

### The future
We have big plans for this book and it's format. To call this a book sort of tarnishes the future direction we want to take it. I want to go beyond plain text and images. I want to take full advantage of the web and new platforms such as mobile and book readers. The book will start to take on a progressive enhancement approach that aims to exploit the benefits of each medium we publish to.

Mediums:

- Paper
- Web
- Video Podcast
- Mac App (From app store)
- Generic eReaders
- iBook
- iPhone, iPdod

Here are some things we want to add in the future:

- Inline Images
- Inline Videos
- User contributed notes, tips, and techniques
- *Paste Bin* - Lets you type and try out code directly in the book without needing to install PHP.
- Interactive graphics that help explain varios concepts
- Interactive quizzes and assessments
- *Prescibed Learning* - Take an assessment, and click a button to build you a personal book with sections you need help in
- Online chat
- Awards and progress indicators for completing chapters and sections
- Sharing tools like Facebook and Twitter

### What you will need
For you to learn PHP in this book, you will need the following things:

- A Computer or Laptop
- A good text editor

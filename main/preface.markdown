There are lots of books out there that teach you the PHP language by syntax, with examples and code that you have to type or paste. Frankly, I am tired of this approach and it is boring for the learner. I have met many would-be PHP developers that have read books, gone through training, tutorials, and other types of approaches and they still don't learn.
 
This book takes a different approach. I will teach you by giving you small development challenges. You will work on these development challenges and learn by seeing and doing. It is a unique and fun way to learn that will get you coding faster, since you are applying what you learn step by step.

You should already have some basic understanding and experience in creating HTML pages and a little CSS.

### More than just PHP
This book aims to go beyond PHP. We will cover all the things a PHP developer should know like HTML, CSS, Databases, and jQuery. Look to the later chapters to learn more.

### Work in progress
This book is a work in progress. We are constantly adding to it and editing it to make it better. It's not completed yet. So you might save it locally, print it, or save to PDF so you don't see change while your using it.

### What you will need
For you to learn PHP in this book, you will need the following things:

- A Computer or Laptop
- A good text editor
- Access to the internet
- Web server with PHP Installed

Look to the section on how to install PHP on your computer.

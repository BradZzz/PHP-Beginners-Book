# BookShelv.com
Get your book online.

BookShelv is a site devoted to helping authors get their books online quickly and easily. It uses Markdown, which is becoming a widely used text format used to author content.

The idea was born out of using a writing tool known as iaWriter. This is a distraction free writing tool for the Mac that uses Markdown to format text. 

**BookShelv is for:**

- Writers of technical books:
- Authors of short stories
- News articles
- Collaborators

## What is Markdown?
A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it?s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. Markdown?s syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like \*emphasis\*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you?ve ever used email.

*He walked over to her and took her into his arms. "It?s not a problem, love. I know a bit about cars, and it looks like a good buy." He laughed ruefully. "Being British, I'm too polite to refuse a kind offer! But I'm sorry if I'm causing any ructions between you and your folks." He sighed, breathing in the scent of her hair. "Mmm! You smell wonderful!"*

*"So do you, sweetheart." She stroked his back. "It's okay, honey. What problems there are between me and my folks were always there, and I guess they always will be. We've learned to live around them. Everything will be okay." She even sounded half-convinced.*

*"You don't get along very well with Caroline," he said, thinking of the younger woman?s strange approach.*
